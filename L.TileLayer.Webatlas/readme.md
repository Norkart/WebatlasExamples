L.TileLayer.Webatlas examples
============================

- These examples demonstrate adding a simple baselayer to your map.
- In the examples the baselayer is `VECTOR`, you can also use `GREY`, `MEDIUM`, `LITE`, `AERIAL` and `HYBRID`.
- There are examples for browserify and webpack using our npm package, and an example of 
npm-free development using a direct reference to the plugin hosted on our servers.
- Remember that you will need to replace the `apikey` variable with your own API key. 
- See [Norkart/L.TileLayer.Webatlas](https://github.com/Norkart/L.TileLayer.Webatlas) for more details
